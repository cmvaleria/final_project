## The problem:

Get access to a credit is never something easy, and Germany is not an exception.  
Thats why I want to know, given certain parameters, what is the probability to get a credit on Germany and what can I do to improve my chances.
The idea is to build an interactive app that can predict if you will probably get a credit or not.

## The DataSet:

The Data Set was build by attribute from Professor Dr. Hans Hofmannâ€™s, and provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository
It contains 1000 applications. In witch the person obtained or not the credit.

## Models applied:

- Logistic Regression 
- K-NN Classifier 
- Random Forest (Exported to 'Models Directory')
- Extra Trees Classifier

## Output:

An App that given certain personal financial imputs it predicts the probability of getting a credit on Germany.
