# KREDIT FATE


## The problem:

Get access to a credit is never something easy, and Germany is not an exception.  
Thats why I want to know, given certain parameters, what is the probability to get a credit on Germany and what can I do to improve my chances.
The idea is to build an interactive app that can predict if you will probably get a credit or not.

## The DataSet:

The Data Set was build by attribute from Professor Dr. Hans Hofmann’s, and provided by UCI Machine Learning Repository
It contains 1000 applications. In witch the person obtained or not the credit.

## Models Applied:

- Logistic Regression 
- K-NN Classifier 
- Random Forest (Exported to 'Models Directory')
- Extra Trees Classifier

## Output:

An App that given certain personal financial imputs it predicts the probability of getting a credit on Germany.
